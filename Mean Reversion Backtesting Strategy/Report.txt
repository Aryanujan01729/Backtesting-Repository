1. Intuition

The Momentum Crossover Strategy is based on a simple yet powerful concept in technical analysis — trend following.
The idea is that:

“An existing trend is more likely to continue than to reverse.”

In this strategy, two moving averages of different lengths (for example, 20-day and 50-day) are compared:

When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term one → it signals a bullish trend → Buy.

When the short-term crosses below the long-term → it signals a bearish trend → Sell or exit.

This approach captures the momentum of price movement, allowing traders to ride large trends while avoiding sideways noise.

2. Mathematical Foundation 

Let P_t be the asset price at time t.
We define two moving averages:

Short-term moving average:
MA_short(t) = (1 / n_s) * Σ from i=0 to n_s-1 of P_(t-i)

Long-term moving average:
MA_long(t) = (1 / n_l) * Σ from i=0 to n_l-1 of P_(t-i)

where n_s < n_l.

Trading Signal:
S_t =  1   if  MA_short(t) > MA_long(t)
S_t = -1   if  MA_short(t) < MA_long(t)

Daily Strategy Return:
R_t = S_(t-1) * ((P_t - P_(t-1)) / P_(t-1))

Cumulative Return:
Cumulative Return = Product over t of (1 + R_t) - 1
